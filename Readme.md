## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

  >I did not use any outside help.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
  
  >The part of the assignment where I had to create the game logic in the guess function was the most difficult for me. When I looked at the answer to help me,
  I felt somewhat cheated. I didn't know what "btn" was and it felt like the code was different from the flowchart I was given. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

  >How do I get better at it? What can help me learn more about web development?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

  >There really isn't much for me to do with this. I still do not know much about web development to know how to improve
  the website any further.
